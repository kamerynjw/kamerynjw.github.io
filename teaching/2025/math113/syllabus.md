**Course Description** Logic clarifies the structure of everyday and mathematical reasoning. At the same time, it brings with it paradox and controversy. We will explore sentential, predicate, multi-valued, modal, and paraconsistent logic as well as elementary set theory, informal argumentation, debating, basic probability theory, formal linguistics, infinity, paradoxes, and some philosophical implications of logical theory.

**Prerequisite** None.

Learning Outcomes
========

This is an introductory logic class. We will study propositional, predicate, and modal logic. When you leave this class you should be able to translate between ordinary language and logical syntax, analyze the semantic content of logical expressions, and write formal proofs.

Grading Policy
=======

Grading for this class is done a specifications model. What this means is, rather than averaging together numerical scores to determine your overall grade, your grade is determined based on meeting specifications in four categories: Assessments, Homework, Journal, and Participation. Assessments and Homework are graded on a high pass/pass/fail scale, while Journal and Participation are graded on a pass/fail scale.

Here's the specifications to earn each grade:

* **A**: High Pass in Assessments and Homework, Pass in Journal and Participation.

* **B**: Not meet the requirements for an A, High Pass in either Assessments or Homework, and Pass in the other three categories.

* **C**: Not meet the requirements for a B, Pass in all four categories.

* **D**: Not meet the requirements for a C, Pass in Journal and Participation.

* **F**: Not meet the requirements for a D.

I reserve the right to use +'s or -'s for borderline cases.

Here's the overview of how each category is graded. Details about the categories are later in the syllabus.

* **Assessments.** There are two quizzes and one exam. Each is graded on a numerical scale.

    * *High Pass.* $90\%$ on the exam and $70\%$ average on quizzes; OR $80\%$ on exam and $90\%$ average on quizzes.

    * *Pass.* $80\%$ on exam; OR $70\%$ average on exam and $70\%$ average on quizzes; OR $60\%$ on exam and $80\%$ average on quizzes.
	
    * *Fail.* Don't meet the requirements for a Pass.

* **Homework.** Homework is assigned weekly and graded on a numerical scale. There are eleven homework assignments in total.

    * *High Pass.* $85\%$ average on homework, miss at most one assignment.

    * *Pass.* $60\%$ average on homework, miss at most three assignments.
	
    * *Fail.* Don't meet the requirements for a Pass.

* **Journal.** You will keep a weekly journal reflecting on your learning. You will submit your journal three times across the semester.

    * *Pass.* Complete all journal entries and do all submissions in a timely manner.
	
    * *Fail.* Don't meet the requirements for a Pass.

* **Participation.** 

    * *Pass.* Regularly attend class, miss at most two Friday activities. 
	
    * *Fail.* Don't meet the requirements for a Pass.


Assessments
===========

There are two quizzes and one exam. Each is an in-class, individual affair. You are allowed one page letter paper ($8.5\text{"} \times 11\text{"}$) of notes for each. Electronic devices are not permitted.

Dates:

* Quiz 1: **Friday, Feb 28**

* Quiz 2: **Friday, Apr 11**

* Exam: **Wednesday, May 7**
	
Homework
========

Homework will be assigned weekly, due in-class the Monday of the following week, with exceptions for weeks with assessments. Most homework will be practice exercises from the textbook. Some exercises ask you to do a logical calculation (e.g. fill out a truth table or produce a formal proof) while others ask for a written explanation.

Homework is graded numerically, with your grade based on completion and a selection of three exercises.

* Rubric for completion

    * 25/25: you did all exercises.
	
    * 15/25: you did most exercises.
	
    * 0/25: you did only a few exercises.
	
* Rubric for technical exercises

    * 25/25: you gave a full correct solution, perhaps with a minor error.

    * 10/25: you were on the right track but were unable to finish or made significant errors.
	
    * 0/25: you didn't make meaningful progress toward a correct solution.

* Rubric for writing exercises

   * 25/25: you gave a full and cogent explanation.

   * 20/25: you had the right idea but struggled to express it in clear prose.

   * 10/25: you had some engagement with the concepts, but weren't able produce the key ideas of the explanation.

   * 0/25: you didn't engage meaningfully with the concepts.
	
You are encouraged to work together on homework, but the work you turn in is expected to be your own. If you do collaborate with classmates, please say so and give their names with your submitted work.

**You have three (3) 'late passes' allowing you to turn in a homework assignment late.** You can submit up to one week after the deadline. If you choose to do this, send me an email to let me know when you'll get the homework to me. Late work is not penalized, but I will not accept late work if you've used up all late passes.

If exceptional circumstances make it impossible for you to keep up with the class material, please talk to me so we can figure out the best solution for what to do.

Journal
=======

You will keep a weekly journal reflecting on your learning. These should be written each Friday or weekend, after the week's work. Each entry should consist of approximately one page of text. On Fridays you will get a prompt to guide your reflection. You should respond to the prompt, but you are not limited to it.

You will submit your journal three times across the semester, after the assessments. Your submission will consist of your full journal, with all entries so far.

Dates:

* First Submission: **By end of weekend of Friday, Feb 28**

* Second Submission: **By end of weekend of Friday, Apr 11**

* Final Submission: **By Friday, May 9**

Participation
=============

Class time will be spent on a combination of lecture, group activities, and assessments. Mondays and Wednesdays will be used to see new material while Fridays  will be used for assessments and activities to help cement that knowledge. You are expected to attend class sessions, as per the college attendance policy. For the Participation portion of your grade you must regularly attend class and miss at most two of the Friday activities. 

If exceptional circumstance means you cannot make an assessment email me in advance so we can set up an alternative. 

If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to ensure you make up the missed lesson. The schedule on the course website gives the textbook sections we will cover each week, and any worksheets or handouts will be posted on the course website. If you know in advance you will have to miss a class, please email me. 

Mathematics has a reputation for being removed from social concerns and identities. Whether or not this is true for the content of mathematics, it is certainly false  for the process of learning mathematics. Our classroom is to be a welcoming one, where everyone feels able to participate and learn regardless of their background or identity. As learners it is your obligation to treat others with respect and generosity, and be willing to exchange ideas with others.

Textbook Information
========

The textbook for this class is Magnus et al., *forall $x$: Calgary*. A copy is hosted on this website: [[PDF]({{ page.parentlink }}forallxyyc.pdf)]. It is also available on [the book's website](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/). There you can find the book in several alternative formats, including a screenreader-compatible HTML version and a PDF version with a dyslexic-friendly font.

*forall $x$: Calgary* is based on *forall $x$: Cambridge*, by Tim Button used under a CC BY 4.0 license, which is based in turn on *forall $x$*, by P. D. Magnus used under a CC BY 4.0 license, and was remixed, revised, & expanded by Aaron Thomas-Bolduc and Richard Zach. It includes additional material from *forall $x$* by P. D. Magnus and *Metatheory* by Tim Button, both used under a CC BY 4.0 license, from *forall $x$: Lorain County Remix*, by Cathal Woods and J.

Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements and homework will be posted to the course website. 

The best way to contact me outside of class is by email. Please put "math 113" in the subject line of your email. If I do not respond by the end of the next weekday, please send me a follow up reminder message.

Office hours are held multiple times in the week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.


Accessibility
=============

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. I am committed to providing you with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications, it is important to get them set up as soon as possible.

Anyone who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Jeannie Altshuler, Director of Accessibility and Academic
Support, in the Win Commons (`jaltshuler@simons-rock.edu`; 413-528-7383).

The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking, sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 

Academic Honesty
========

You are expected to know and uphold the college’s policies on academic honesty as described in the Student Handbook. Mathematics classes form part of the core base of skills you need to succeed in many later classes, and you are harming yourself if you try to avoid learning the material for this class.

The use of ChatGPT or other AI tools is prohibited. Submitted work using these tools will receive a zero, with no chance for making up the lost points. I reserve the right to escalate the consequences for repeated violations.

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates for homework, but the work you submit is expected to be your own. If you do work with others, please say so and give their names with your submitted homework.


Other Campus Resources
=====

The [Wellness Center Health and Counseling Services](https://simons-rock.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/wellness-center.php), as the name says, offers health and counseling services. 

The [Win Student Resources Commons](https://simons-rock.edu/early-college/contact-us/offices-and-departments/win-commons.php) offers academic support, tutoring, accessibility, and career advice.
