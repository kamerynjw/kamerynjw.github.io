Homework
--------

* **Week 4 (Due Monday 2/24)** Section 6.6: (only find the mass and center of mass) #1, 2, 3, 39, 40, 41, 42; Section 6.7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 16, 23, 33. 

    Writing: The *exponential distribution* with parameter $\lambda$ is the probability distribution with density function $\rho_\lambda(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$, where $x \ge 0$. Confirm this really is a probability density function and determine its mean. (Extra Credit) The *Cauchy distribution* with parameter $\gamma$ is the probability distribution with density function $\rho_\gamma(x) = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma[1 + (\frac{x}{\gamma})^2]}$, where $x$ can be any value. Confirm that this really is a probability density function and determine its mean. Explain.
    
* **Week 3 (Due Monday 2/17)** Section 6.3: #1, 2, 3, 5; Section 6.4 #1, 2, 4, 13, 14; Section 6.5 #1, 2, 9, 10, 16.

    Writing: Using integration, give an explanation to justify the formula $A = 4\pi r^2$ for the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$. (Extra Credit) Write a computer program which uses numerical integration (Riemann sums, trapezoidal rule, or Simpson's rule) to approximately calculate arc lengths of curves $y = f(x)$.

* **Week 2 (Due Monday 2/10)** Section 6.1: #1, 2, 5, 6; Section 6.2 #1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 12, 27, 28, 47, 49, 50

    Writing: Using integration, give an explanation to justify the formula $V = \frac{\pi}{3}r^2 h$ for the volume of a circular cone of radius $r$ at the base and height $h$. (Extra Credit) A regular tetrahedron is the solid with four faces, each an equally sized equilateral triangles. Determine a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with side length $s$, and give an explanation to justify it.

* **Week 1 (Due Monday 2/3)** Extra Problems Page 41: #9, 12, 14, 17; Extra Problems Page 103: #31, 32, 34; Extra Problems Page 234: #7, 9, 10, 29, 30.

    Writing: Write the statement of the fundamental theorem of calculus (both parts!) and give an informal explanation for why it is true. (Extra Credit) The Transfer Principle says that any equality or inequality about real functions true in the reals is also true in the hyperreals. We could formulate the same principle but going from the rational numbers to the real numbers: "Any equality or inequality about rational functions true in the rationals is also true in the reals." Is this rational to real transfer principle true or false? Justify your answer

Schedule
--------

This course is organized into three units. Units 1 and 2 each end in a midterm, while unit 3 ends in the oral final. Homework is assigned weekly.

The schedule below is tentative; we might have small adjustments in the dates. For each week I've included which sections from the textbook we will be covering.

* Unit 1 (1/27–2/28): **Applications of integration**

    * Week 1: Intro, review
	
    * Week 2: Volume [6.1, 6.2]
	
    * Week 3: Arc length, surface area, averages [6.3, 6.4, 6.5]
	
    * Week 4: Applications to physics, improper integrals [6.6, 6.7]
	
    * Week 5: Overspill, review, exam
	
* Unit 2 (3/3–4/16): **Advanced integration, series**

    * Week 6: Integration by parts, trig integrals [7.4, 7.5]
